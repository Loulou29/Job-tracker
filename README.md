Job tracking Excel from HTML webpages
================

## Background

Many job websites don’t have a built-in “export” function, to allow
users to create an Excel sheet with key description of the jobs
(e.g. company names, positions, deadlines, etc.).

## Goal

My codes converted job information on an html page into a manageable
Excel sheet, so that I can prioritize my job applications and not miss
application deadlines.
