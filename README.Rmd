title: "Job tracking Excel from HTML webpages"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Background

Many job websites don't have a built-in "export" function, to allow users to create an Excel sheet with key description of the jobs (e.g. company names, positions, deadlines, etc.).

## Goal

My codes converted job information on an html page into a manageable Excel sheet, so that I can prioritize my job applications and not miss application deadlines.
